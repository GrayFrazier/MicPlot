A python tool for plotting .mic files which display data for polycrystalline materials.  Based in Carnegie Mellon University Physics/Material Science Department under Professor Robert M. Suter.

##How to Use:
Use the PlotMic.py tool to plot the .mic file to display.  Upon doing so, the entire image will appear on your display.  To replot a specific grain, click on the said grain.  Doing so will show the average information about that area. To replot, simply press "enter" which will prompt a new window with the more specific grain.  Doing so will enhance the differences in the grain.
