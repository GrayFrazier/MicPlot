    Top to Bottom and then Left to Right
    This is already assumed in the files, but just to be safe :)
    Assumes all z are the same

def square_borders(SquareMic, SquareMicData):
    '''
    Returns a collection of borders
    Includes the two points, and the left/up voxel and the right/down voxel
    voxel data in form of:
        0-2: voxelpos [x,y,z]
        3-5: euler angle
        6: hitratio
        7: maskvalue. 0: no need for recon, 1: active recon region
        8: voxelsize
        9: additional information
    In the form [(x,y), (x,y), left/up, right/down]
